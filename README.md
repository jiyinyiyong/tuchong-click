Tuchong-click, show me next picture!
------

When I was visiting Tuchong, it took me so much effort to click.
I really hope I could write myself a robot and load it.

I'm able to write simple Chrome extensions now:
install my plugin and start here: http://tuchong.com/group/623/

It's supposed to click "next" every one second.
If you move your mouse, than you need to click the page by your self.
I mean, don't forget to click the heart when a picture impresses you, say "I like that".

Test on Ubuntu 13.04 , Chrome unstable 29
